JSP stands for Java Server Pages. Files that contain the .jsp file extension are server-generated web pages. These JSP pages are very similar to ASP and PHP page files, however, instead of containing ActiveX or PHP code, the JSP file contains Java code.

When a user's computer sends the JSP file to the Web server, the JSP file is then parsed and will generate a HTML code that is sent back to the user's PC. Web developers use JSP files to create dynamic website pages that are based on XML, HTML and other document formats.

The JSP file format was developed in order to address the fact that people felt that Java didn't provide application developers with enough support for Web development purposes.
